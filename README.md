# JpMorgan_Task3


Task 3 Objective 

Aim: Use Perspective to generate a chart that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing manner for traders to monitor this trading strategy.
Basically, we have to modify the existing live chart to be able to 
(1) track and display the ratio between the two stock prices .
(2) show the historical upper and lower bounds of the stocks' ratio .
(3) finally, show 'alerts' whenever these bounds are crossed by the ratio.

How to Run
Similar to Task 2, start the data feed server by running the python server

Make sure your terminal / command line is in the repository first before doing any of this.

If you are using Windows, make sure to run your terminal/command prompt as administrator.

python datafeed/server3.py

If you encounter an issue with datautil.parser, run this command:

pip install python-dateutil
If you don't have pip, you can install it from: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Run npm install && npm start to start the React application.

It's okay to have audit warnings when installing/running the app.

If you don't have npm (although you should if you followed the set up / installation part), you can install the recommended version alongside NodeJS 
from: https://nodejs.org/en/

The recommended version are node v11.0.0 and npm v6.4.1

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
